Can you give me a step by step short descripton... For example if it was the "Faculty" Sequence diagram...

@startuml

actor Faculty
participant "Course Management System" as CMS
database "Course Database" as DB

Faculty -> CMS: Login
Faculty -> CMS: View Descriptions of Courses
CMS -> DB: Fetch Descriptions of Courses
DB --> CMS: Descriptions of Courses
Faculty -> CMS: Select the Desired Course
CMS -> DB: Add Course to Faculty's Assignment
DB --> CMS: Course Added to Faculty's Assignment
Faculty -> CMS: Modify the Current Course Selection
CMS -> DB: Update Faculty's Course Assignment
DB --> CMS: Current Course Selection Updated
Faculty -> CMS: View the Final Course Schedule
CMS -> DB: Create the Final Course Schedule
DB --> CMS: Final Course Schedule
CMS --> Faculty: Final Course Schedule

@enduml

The the steps would be as follows...


In the Sequence Diagram above, the "Faculty" actor interacts with the Course Management System (CMS) for course assignment. Here are the steps in this scenario:
1.	The “Faculty” member logs in to the CMS.
2.	The “Faculty” member views the descriptions of the courses.
3.	The CMS fetches the descriptions of the courses from the CMS Database.
4.	The Course Database provides the descriptions of the courses to the CMS.
5.	The “Faculty” member selects the desired course for assignment.
6.	The CMS adds the course to the “Faculty” member's assignment in the CMS Database.
7.	The CMS Database confirms that the course has been added to “Faculty” member's assignment.
8.	The faculty member modifies their current course selection or assignment if needed.
9.	The CMS updates the “Faculty” member's course assignment in the CMS Database.
10.	The CMS Database confirms that “Faculty” member's current course selection has been updated.
11.	The “Faculty” member views the final course schedule.
12.	The CMS generates the final course schedule by accessing the CMS Database.
13.	The CMS Database provides the final course schedule to the CMS.
14.	The CMS provides the final course schedule to the “Faculty” member.

Can you do the same for "Administrator" Sequence diagram
